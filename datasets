Project Idea : The project is a Secret Code Breaker game, where the player tries to guess a randomly generated 4-digit code within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on the number of correct digits and correct positions in each guess. Key features of the project include:
• A randomly generated 4-digit code (digits between 1 and 9). • Player input validation to ensure proper guesses.
• Feedback after each guess: the number of digits guessed correctly and how many are in the correct positions.
• A high score system stored in a file, tracking the number of remaining guesses when the player successfully cracks the code.
• The game ends when the player either guesses the code or runs out of attempts. This project combines logic, randomness, file handling, and user interaction in Python.
